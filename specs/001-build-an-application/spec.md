# Feature Specification: Climbing Progress Tracker Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`  
**Created**: September 13, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help keep track of user climbing progress over time. The application should allow users to log their climbing sessions, including details such as date, location, type of climb (bouldering, sport climbing), difficulty level, and notes. Users should be able to view their climbing history, analyze their progress with charts or graphs, and set goals for future climbs. Nowadays, climbing gyms often have their own grading systems, so the application should allow users to customize difficulty levels based on their local gym's grading system. The user should be able to log in and out of the application securely, with options for password recovery and account management, the user data should be saved so it can be imported from other platforms or new devices. The application should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. (Some of the features mentioned are already implemented, so you can learn from the existing codebase and build upon it.)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A climber wants to track their climbing progress over time by logging sessions, viewing history, analyzing performance, and setting future goals. They want to use their local gym's grading system and access their data securely across devices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they log a new climbing session with date, location, type, difficulty, and notes, **Then** the session appears in their climbing history.
2. **Given** a user with multiple logged sessions, **When** they view their progress, **Then** the application displays charts/graphs showing trends over time.
3. **Given** a user, **When** they set a climbing goal, **Then** the goal is saved and tracked against future sessions.
4. **Given** a user, **When** they customize the grading system, **Then** the application uses the selected system for all relevant features.
5. **Given** a user, **When** they log out and log in on another device, **Then** their climbing data is available.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to log a session with missing required fields?
- How does the system handle a user importing data from an unsupported platform?
- What if a user forgets their password?
- How does the system handle simultaneous logins from multiple devices?
- What if a gym changes its grading system after sessions have been logged?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to log climbing sessions with date, location, type, difficulty, and notes.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a history of logged climbing sessions for each user.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide visual analysis (charts/graphs) of user climbing progress over time.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to set and track climbing goals.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support customizable grading systems for difficulty levels.
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users securely and allow login/logout. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide password recovery and account management features.
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist user data and allow import/export for cross-platform/device access. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: supported import/export formats?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST be responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle errors gracefully and provide user feedback for failed actions. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error handling behaviors?]

### Key Entities
- **User**: Represents a climber; attributes include name, email, password, account settings, grading system preference.
- **ClimbingSession**: Represents a logged session; attributes include date, location, type, difficulty, notes, associated user.
- **Goal**: Represents a climbing goal; attributes include target difficulty, type, timeframe, progress status, associated user.
- **GradingSystem**: Represents a set of difficulty levels; attributes include system name, grade list, associated gym.

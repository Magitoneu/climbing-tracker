# Tasks: Climbing Progress Tracker Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-an-application/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
2. Load optional design documents: data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md
3. Generate tasks by category: setup, tests, core, integration, polish
4. Apply task rules: parallel/sequential, TDD, dependencies
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Cloud Sync & User Accounts Tasks
TCS1 ✅ Research and choose a backend/cloud solution (Firebase recommended for Expo) — completed
TCS2 ✅ Set up Firebase project and enable Authentication and Firestore — completed
TCS3 ✅ Install Firebase SDK for Expo: `pnpm add firebase` — completed
TCS4 ✅ Implement authentication logic: Create login, signup, and password recovery screens. Integrate Firebase Auth for user management. — completed
TCS5 (Sessions) ✅ Refactor session storage to use Firestore when authenticated; fallback to local offline cache.
TCS5c (Sessions edit/delete) ✅ Integrate Firestore update & delete with optimistic local fallback.
TCS5a (Goals) Refactor goal storage to Firestore with offline fallback.
TCS5b (Custom grading systems) Refactor grading system storage to Firestore; ensure per-user isolation.
TCS6 (Core sync) ▲ Implement full bidirectional sync for goals & grading systems; clear local user scope on logout.
TCS7 ✅ Migrate legacy local sessions automatically on first authenticated load (basic heuristic).
TCS7a Add manual “retry migration” / import UI for sessions & goals.
TCS8 Update settings/profile UI: account management (change password, logout, delete account, provider linking).
TCS8a Add Google auth fix (redirect + provider linking) and surface errors clearly.
TCS9 ▲ Test cross-device sync for sessions, goals, grading systems (multi-platform matrix: iOS, Android, Web).
TCS9a Add offline queue & retry for failed writes (sessions/goals/grades).
TCS9b Add per-document cloud/local status indicator in UI.
TCS10 Update documentation and onboarding flow (cloud sync behavior, offline mode, migration).
TCS11 Security hardening: final Firestore rules (least privilege) + rules tests.
TCS12 Add integration tests for cloud sync (mock Firestore or emulator layer).
TCS13 Performance: pre-aggregate stats (max grade, flash counts) in session docs.
TCS14 Analytics/telemetry (optional) for feature usage.

## Parallel Execution Guidance
- Tasks marked [P] can be executed in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Example: T005-T009 (contract tests), T010-T014 (models), T026-T029 (integration tests), T030-T034 (polish)
- Core service and endpoint tasks (T017-T019) should follow after models and contract tests
- UI tasks (T035-T036) can be started after core data and service logic is available

## Dependency Notes
- Setup tasks (T001-T004) must be completed first
- Contract tests (T005-T009) before endpoint implementation (T017-T019)
- Models (T010-T014) before services/endpoints
- Integration tasks (T020-T024) after core implementation
- Integration tests (T026-T029) after integration
- Polish tasks (T030-T034) last
- UI tasks (T035-T036) after core logic
